#
# This PR shares our efforts to run `codecov` on versions of Ruby <= 2.4.
#
# Give some of our projects require us to support users with older versions of Ruby, we need a code coverage solution that can handle these older Ruby releases.
#
# This PR is based on v0.1.21 and allows for submission of coverage reports for Ruby 2.0+.
#
# Given the deprecation warning of `0.1.x` in the README I completely understand if this change is not desired at this moment. My intention is to allow for users with similar cases to ours to have a working implementation available.
